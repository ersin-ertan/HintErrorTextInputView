Relies on private fields in design library.
Single values will overwrite textAppearance values


todo

remove dependencies on private design lib
add ability to change, both hints textAppearance
add ability to change textAppearance state when not selected, when error, when overflowed...

get the text appearance and when visible set the text appearance of the view? and only change
the color manually?

  font family ? or let the text appearance do both?

might have to look at unfocused hint color, for text label and manualy change it because when the hint
animation is enabled, it might come down overlapping the empty hint... look into this

look into why the view is so large if the error is enabled, curently the lib turns on and off
the error, changing the allowing for a smaller initial size

unfocused for floating label and hint
